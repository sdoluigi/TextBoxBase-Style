# TextBoxBase-Style
Example project to explain the use of TextBoxStyle

This project is just an example of what is explained in the post: "WPF â€“ A sample of a TextBox Style for mandatory fields with validation error management", 
that can be read here: https://blog.sdosas.it/wpf-a-sample-of-a-textbox-style-for-mandatory-fields-with-validation-error-management/.

It is not supposed to be used at production level. The use of the code is free and at you own risk.
